# hello-world

Hi Everyone, 


This is my first commit change and I wanted everyone to know about it! 
I enjoy learning Python at the moment and hope to pick up react.js soon.
I am asipiring to become a developer because you can be creative with code and build something from your mind!
Thanks for reading..
